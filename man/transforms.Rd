\title{parameter transformation objects}
\description{
transformation objects used internally in GPflowR
}
\details{
This module will likely be unexported and not formally documented in
  the near future. This is essentially a test run of the module documentation
  set up
}
\section{Usage}{
 \preformatted{

 # transform objects
 transforms$Identity()
 transforms$Exp(lower = 1e-6)
 transforms$Log1pe(lower = 1e-6)
 transforms$Logistic(a = 0, b = 1)
 transforms$positive(lower = 1e-6)
  
 # transform object member functions
 t <- transforms$Identity()
 t$forward(-3)
 t$backward(0.5)
 t$tf_forward(-3)
 t$tf_log_jacobian(-3)
  }
}

\section{Arguments}{

\describe{
\item{lower}{The minimum value that positive transforms can take. This helps
stability during optimization, because aggressive optimizers can take
overly-long steps which lead to zero in the transformed variable, causing an
error.}
\item{a, b}{The location (\code{a}) and scale (\code{b}) of the logistic 
distribution used in the logistic transform.}
}
}
